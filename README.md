# Active-Directory and OsTicket Home Lab Practice
This demonstrates some examples of ticket lifestyles that could occur in a real world environment. 

# User Password Reset Practice

In this project, I act out a sitation where a user has forgotten their password and has been locked out of their account. I submit a ticket (as the locked out user) and respond to the issue. I then reset the Active Directory password for the user, and lastly, communicate with the user to ensure them the issue is resolved.
